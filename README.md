# Quick CLI runner

A quick (get it?) script to run your [Quick][4] tests on the commandline. 
So you can üî• your Xcode projects.

## Installation

You will need [Rome][1] and [xctester][2] already installed to use this.

```shell
$ brew install xctester
$ gem install cocoapods cocoapods-rome
```

Note: this needs Xcode 6.3

## Usage

Build the necessary frameworks when using this for the first time:

```shell
$ pod install --no-integrate --project-directory=vendor
```

Running the tests from the Quick [README][3] looks like this:

```shell
$ ./quick.sh code/*.swift
QuickSpec
